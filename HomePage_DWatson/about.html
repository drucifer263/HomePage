            <p>I currently have 3 - 4 jobs and I got to school full time. How do I do it I DONT KNOW. I will probably
                have to drop a couple classes because I can't afford it anyway. I have experience in different aspects of the
                IT world, from hardware to software. I would like to expand my knowledge and see where it will take me. </p>
