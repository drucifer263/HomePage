        <h4>My thoughts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Lab 1</h4>
                <p>
                    CSS and HTML can be annoying. I enjoy programming but sometimes getting the dependencies and the CSS work correctly can be a pain.
                    I have very little experience in HTML and CSS3, so making this website was a tab bit difficult. There are times where I enjoy web development and other
                    times where I hate it. Getting the pages and elements the right amount of padding and space can be a difficult task. I did not use too many expert CSS
                    stylings. It is pretty basic. I used a few tags that were different like the marquee tag but I just mostly used nesting, ids, and class to format everything.
                </p>

                <h4>Lab 2</h4>
                <p>
                    Making a responsive website was not so bad at all. The only trouble that I had was actually filling the page up with content. It is a bit everywhere and it still has some
                    placeholder content for now until I can find the right pictures to fill it in. I changed the content from Cats to about Overwatch and in the middle of the transition I realized
                    that the lab was actually due lol. I just turned in what I had and will just update it sooner than later. The website performs all the functions it is suppose to I just need to
                    spruce it up a bit. Over all I enjoyed building the site and found it not too hard, just the creativity part stumped me. I also planned and compartmentilized it way too much.
                </p>

            <li>
                <h4>Lab 3</h4>
                <p>
                    This lab was a bit harder in all respects. Javascript is very fickle and you can easily make an error that sets you back for hours. There were many times were I was missing a capital
                    letter or a semi colon and parts of the script just would not work. The hardest part was just getting the random numbers to not regenerate. I think that mine still generates one or
                    two numbers in a repeat. I will have to go back in to find the issue with it. I think that I was not tracking or removing my indexes properly. The timed invterval was a bit hard but I found the
                    cookie creating to be the hardest. Lucky I had some internet sources and some people from class to help me out with some of it. Over all I found it tough but I got thourgh it.

                <h4>Lab 4</h4>
                <p>
                    The difficult part for me for this lab was some of the JQuery calls. I would accidentaly leave out th # in the JQuery builder and nothing would work. Finding the correct way to append each div was also
                    a bit difficult. Dealing with the session object was not that bad but it was mostly due to the experience I had with using the localstorage object. Trying to do everything in reverse was a bit hard to
                    figure out when it came to parsing the JSON string. I feel that in the end I did learn a lot about JQuery and also how to handle a JSON and storage options. It was terribly frustrating and yet perfectly
                    exhilarting to get it to function. I just wish that I had more time to make it look better.

            <li>
                <h4>Lab 5</h4>
                <p>
                    This was one of the harder labs to accomplish due to the relatively new format of RESTful instead of SOAP. All of the trouble was with setting up the Web API to retreive the correct elements from the data base
                     and correct all the issues with the server. The complications with how the sever is configured and what is or isnt allowed made this lab a real pain. I was only able to implememt a few url templates but this lab
                    was left largley un done. I will be going back to correct this lab in the next couple days. All the 502.5, 500, 404, etc errors were a real setback to actually getting and using the API. I did learn alot from this
                    and the next few labs though.

                <h4>Lab 6</h4>
                <p>
                    This was the most fun lab that I had all semester. This is mostly due to the fact that we could use just about any web api and consume it how we wanted to. I picked the Giphy API and just executed a few different search
                    functinalities. I tried 4 of them : Search with a tag, Search with a keyword, Translate, and Trending. It just grabs different gifs depending on each search criteria and it was quick and easy to use. It took a couple days to
                    research but everything after that was fun just setting up and experimenting. Cool stuff.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Lab 7</h4>
                <p>
                    I made this lab out to be much longer and harder than it needed to be but it still was hard to do. I wish that we had a few extra days to complete it and it wasnt so rushed. I did enjoy it in the end but it was one of the more
                    frustrating things this semester to understand. Angular has so many different parts it can be a bit overwhelming to use initially. Wish this lab was introduced a bit earlier or with a bit more time to digest and enjoy.

                <h4>Tutorial Project</h4>
                <p>
                    Leaflet was a blast to use and research. It was made to be light weight and easy to use/read and it was just that. I learned a bunch on how to use and execute a web api and framework at the same time. The tutorial taught me a bunch
                    when it comes to making interactive, comprehensive and complex web applications.
